# Geomerative for Processing to G-code

This is a re-upload of **[rikrd](https://github.com/rikrd)'s** [Geomerative](http://www.ricardmarxer.com/geomerative/) library for **Processing**, adapted to work seamlessly with the **Processing to G-code** boilerplate by **[sighack](https://github.com/sighack)**.

## Purpose

The original Geomerative library enables advanced vector shape manipulation in Processing. This fork ensures compatibility with sighack's Processing-to-Gcode pipeline, making it easier to generate G-code from vector graphics and typography.

> ðŸ’¡ This is an **older version** of the library, but it's known to **work reliably** in this context.

## Usage

Drop the `geomerative` library folder into your Processing `libraries/` directory. Then, you can use it in your Processing sketches that generate G-code.
